crisis but it s not enough to just turn things around we have to build back b the future must be made in america by all of america here s how we ll do it as i was saying four years of betsy devos is more than enough we need a secretary of education who is actually a public school educator i commend the task forces for their service and for helping build a bold transformative platform for our party and increased testing isn t the reason for the surge in coronavirus cases donald trump s failed leadership is trump launched his campaign by calling mexicans rapists he s spread racism against our latino community ever let me be clear no one should be forced out of their home in the middle of a pandemic because they can t pay rent when there were cases the president said it wouldn t spread any farther we just hit our millionth case w adybarkan the courage you show every day is an inspiration to so many and i m grateful to have you by my side this is a national disgrace we have to ensure these communities get the care they need immediately and then tack the most sacred obligation of our government is to keep our troops safe when we send them into battle and to care across the world

and countless ot on this venezuelan independence day my thoughts are with venezuelans who continue to work tirelessly for the cause covid is surging across the nation and this president is doubling down on his efforts to rip health insurance a donald trump wants to declare this health crisis over and unemployment solved so that he can get back to his campai the hard truth is that it didn t have

the courage and strength you ve shown in the face of daunting odds is an inspiration to us all i m confide workers called back on the job deserve access to regular reliable covid testing instead of passing police reform or helping hardworking americans get through this crisis republicans are jamming we need a president who will expand access to quality affordable health care not rip it away to everyone who is scared hurting and wondering what s going to happen next i want you to know i see you i hear our planet cannot take four more years of donald trump the american people are tough resilient and always full of hope there s not a single thing we can t do if we do it together it s clear donald trump will stop at nothing to tear down obamacare and rip health care away from millions we cann it s pretty simple if we want to save people s jobs and save people s lives we need more testing and we need it this is yet another attempt to distract from this administration s failure to lead an effective response to covid it s worth repeating that this weekend president trump admitted he directed his administration to slow down corona to ashley and all the health care workers on the front lines of this fight thank you you are american heroes tomorrow president barackobama and i are hosting a virtual grassroots fundraiser we ll be answering some of your the strength of the lgbtq community has always been rooted in the ability to find hope in spite of setbacks if we no one should have to choose between their paycheck and their health that s why my plan for a safe and effective r we can overcome four years of donald trump but if we give him eight years in the white house he will forever alte from my days as a public defender to my time as vice president i ve spent my career fighting against injustice a trump talks tough on venezuela but admires thugs and dictators like nicolas maduro as president i will stand w trump opposed sanctioning china s government over its atrocious human rights violations to protect his hollow trade my dad instilled a lot in me but perhaps most important is the belief that there s no higher calling than to be a i can t believe i have to say this but we should be speeding up testing not slowing it down it s in some of our darkest moments of despair that we ve made some of our greatest progress if we stand together speed up the testing i ve found that the way to overcome enormous tragedy in your life is to turn that grief and pain into purpose chri this nation has always strived to serve as a beacon of hope but trump has made it clear that he does not believe o folks credit me for speaking out on marriage equality in but i m not the one who took a real risk countless donald trump is so eager to get back to his campaign rallies that he s willing to put people at risk and violate cd the tulsa race massacre is one of the worst incidents of racial violence in our history and it has been erased fr christian cooper s encounter in central park was another wake up call for our nation and a reminder of the work tha we re months into this pandemic and still don t have proper testing ppe or clear nationwide guidance instead do i know it can be hard to keep faith that we will ever achieve that more perfect union we strive to be but ours is donald trump s failure to fight the coronavirus with the same energy and focus that he uses to troll his enemies on i ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation who we are what we on june in galveston tx the last enslaved african americans were finally given notice of their freedom juneteenth reminds us of how vulnerable our nation is to being poisoned by systems and acts of inhumanity but it s amy from the

pres obamacare was a big deal and that still holds true a decade later on its tenth anniversary we need to double do a billion slush fund for corporations with almost no conditions is unacceptable we

we should also increase monthly social security checks by month as proposed by senator wyden and colleagues additionally we should forgive a minimum of person of federal student loans as proposed by senator warren on march th donald trump claimed anybody that wants a test can get a test that was a flat out lie then and no bill should pass without immediate generous relief for workers who are

about yesterday rather than wh now he s switched to falsely telling us that he s taking action that he has not taken and promising results that h in times of crisis the american people deserve a president who tells them the truth and takes responsibility dona if you have a minute read these stories of folks coming together and helping out their neighbors they represent w the president says no one cares about being tested have you or a loved one had trouble getting tested getting money quickly to families is the right goal but senate republicans are proposing to send significantly low the lack of coronavirus testing in the u s is a national disgrace the least we can do for every grocery and retail worker working around the clock during this crisis is to provide a every ceo in america should be focusing on workers families and communities not executive compensation and share prices i am calling on every ceo in america to publicly commit now to not buying back their company s stock

brave young woman who saw what was happening in her hometown of charlottesville and decided to three years ago today white supremacists descended on charlottesville with torches in hand and hate in their heart let s get to work kamalaharris one of the reasons i chose kamalaharris is because we both believe you can define america in one simple word possibilities if you re worried about whether you ll have job worried about the poisons in the air you breathe and water you d working families need someone on their side because they certainly don t have anyone on their side with this pres this morning little girls woke up across this nation especially black and brown girls who so often may feel over we ve all watched kamalaharris in the senate go toe to toe with trump officials trying to

for us and as president he ll build an am back when kamala was attorney general she worked closely with beau i watched as they took on the big banks lifte i have the great honor to announce that i ve picked kamalaharris fearless fighter for the little guy and one don t forget that in the middle of this pandemic the trump administration is in court trying to eliminate obamacar i promise you if i m elected i won t waste any time getting this virus under control i ll call dr fauci and ask this is the latest dire consequence of donald trump looking the other way on beijing s repression in hong kong ins social security is the bedrock of american retirement giving countless americans peace of mind and the ability to folks we need to listen to our frontline heroes wear mask it s not just about you it s about keeping your fam bristol bay is no place for mine our administration decided that in we re only discussing it today becaus donald trump said that if he s re elected he ll defund social security we can t let that happen president trump keeps attacking the u s postal service and now hundreds of thousands of veterans aren t getting t donald trump s surrender to the pandemic has led to resurgence of the virus and more economic pain and anxiety fo to the millions of americans struggling to get by right now those who can t find job or pay the bills i want y every single eligible american should have the opportunity to vote by mail this november if it s good enough for d we can t let donald trump destroy the u s postal service it s been six years since michael brown s life was taken in ferguson reigniting movement we must continue the our planet can t take four more years of donald trump we have to get him out of the white house so we can start tr rt teamjoe we seriously can t wait to see who s going to join teamjoe text first to to be the first to know when joebiden makes giving the trump administration another four years in office would have catastrophic implications for future genera the united states just passed million reported infections of covid it s number that boggles the mind and br today donald trump stated that if re elected he ll undermine the entire financial footing of social security ou donald trump has refused to take serious action to combat the covid crisis and as result he got what he s al it s an important choice and i want you to be one of the first to know who i ve picked as my running mate text f between the coronavirus and the economic crisis this is tough time for our country i know but i firmly believe the fact is donald trump left our nation unprepared and unprotected for the worst public health crisis of our life our nation is desperate for leadership leadership that can unite us and steer us through these crises but at the no president can promise to prevent future outbreaks but i ll promise you this when i m president we will prepare over the last century america has defined itself by rising to meet existential challenges and we have that oppor john lewis will be remembered as moral giant who dedicated his life to creating more just equal and moral ame i can t believe i have to say this but we can t let donald trump open up the grand canyon for uranium mining i believe every american deserves fair shot at success not just the mar lago crowd that s why as president it didn t have to be this bad here s the truth donald trump turned his back on the middle class long before covid he cut taxes for the super make no mistake this economic crisis is due to president trump s failure to get this virus under control while i am grateful for the people who got their jobs back my heart goes out to the more than million americans the truth is that president trump could have acted months ago to curb this pandemic it s obvious he still hasn t le here s how covid affected arizonans under the trump ducey model an infection rate still of nearly the gov ducey is rushing reopening without adequate testing and contact tracing he s withholding support for increas president trump called arizona model for applying science based approach to the decreasing cases and hospitali my commitment to you is this i will always listen i will never stop fighting for the african american community throughout my career i ve witnessed the diversity of thought background and sentiment within the african american earlier today i made some comments about diversity in the african american and latino communities that i want to c i believe that the right to vote is the most fundamental american right there is to protect it we ve got to p john lewis left us with marching orders it s up to all of us to carry them out every moment with your loved ones is precious i know that in my core because i ve learned it through loss it s wh let me be clear voting is right not privilege anyone who tells you otherwise can t be trusted to hold the h the fight for civil rights is what drove me to get involved in politics in the first place it s why i fought for years ago today the voting rights act was signed into law bringing us one step closer to that more perfect un the scenes of death and destruction from hiroshima and nagasaki still horrify us years later they reach through if i m elected president our students and educators will have all the tools and resources they need to succeed and donald trump promised to bring back jobs but his policies crushed the manufacturing sector and that was true even growing up in scranton i learned the importance of hard work treating others with dignity and respect and leavin folks lot of you have been asking when i m announcing my running mate and i promise i ll let you know soon but i don t buy for one second that the vitality of american manufacturing is thing of the past as president i ll m there s been lot of talk about my vetting process lately here s an inside look weapons of war have no place in our communities when i was senator i took on the nra and secured year ban eight years ago white supremacist targeted sikh temple in oak creek wi ultimately taking seven lives in an i truly believe that we can revitalize american manufacturing and create better economy at the same time i want the truth of the matter is donald trump inherited growing economy from president obama and me and just like eve from day one donald trump downplayed the threat covid posed ignored scientists and refused to take action on day one i ll send bill to congress creating clear roadmap to citizenship for dreamers and the million un our hearts and prayers are with the people of lebanon and the victims of the horrific explosion in beirut i urge thousands of americans are dying every week the president s response it is what it is i ll get to work on day one enacting the changes needed to help the latino community thrive read my full plan her happy birthday to my brother and friend barackobama serving alongside you for eight years was the greatest honor

away from millions we cann it s pretty simple if we want to save people s jobs and save people s lives we need more testing and we need it this is yet another attempt to distract from this

the strength of the lgbtq community has always been rooted in the ability to find hope in spite of setbacks if we no one should have to choose between their paycheck and their health that s why my

president i ve spent my career fighting against injustice trump talks tough on venezuela but admires thugs and dictators like nicolas maduro as president i will stand w trump opposed sanctioning china s government over its atrocious human rights violations to protect his hollow trade my dad instilled lot in me but perhaps most important is the belief that there s no higher calling than to be i can t believe i have to say this but we should be speeding up testing not slowing it down it s in some of our darkest moments of despair that we ve made some of our greatest progress if we stand together speed up the testing i ve found that the way to overcome enormous tragedy in your life is to turn that grief and pain into purpose chri this nation has always strived to serve as beacon of hope but trump has made it clear that he does not believe o folks credit me for speaking out on marriage equality in but i m not the one who took real risk countless donald trump is so eager to get back to his campaign rallies that he s willing to put people at risk and violate cd the tulsa race massacre is one of the worst incidents of racial violence in our history and it has been erased fr christian

takes responsibility dona if you have minute read these stories of folks coming together and helping out their neighbors they represent w the president says no one cares about being tested have you or loved one had trouble getting tested getting money quickly to families is the right goal but senate republicans are proposing to send significantly low the lack of coronavirus testing in the u s is national disgrace the least we can do for every grocery and retail worker working around the clock during this crisis is to provide every ceo in america should be focusing on workers families and communities not executive compensation and share prices i am calling on every ceo in america to publicly commit now to not buying back their company s stock over the cours sengillibrand has never been
